# LabVIEW-Arduino-Fire-Detection-System

A fire alarm system is used for safety reasons in different areas. In this project, such a system will be designed to detect a fire, control it and alert individuals about it by turning on a buzzer and a fan. The process of detecting fire will depend on two factors, fire/ and smoke. Two sensors will be used to identify the situation of the area. A microcontroller is the link between the computer and sensors.
